In this script, the Agent class represents the agent that can process questions and provide answers. 
The main loop allows the user to create a new agent, upload files, ask questions, or exit the program. The user input is processed accordingly, and the agent's responses are displayed.
The upload_files method allows the user to upload files, and the process_question method searches for the answer in the uploaded files. If the answer is found, it is returned; otherwise, a default answer is provided.
